## Use at your own risk

This is a stripped out copy of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for the most part.
I've removed lots of files and plugins I didn't find needed
for my daily use and I've modified some plugins to my liking.

Follow [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) guide to get started with their project
if you're looking for a stable nvim distro instead.

## Why didn't I use LazyVim's starter project?

I found their [starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) config a bit harder to modify.
Also, I like to have control over the config so that I can
tweak as much as needed.
